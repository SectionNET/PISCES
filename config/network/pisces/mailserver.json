you hear it dont you. the whisper thru trees. goatswood. it not village, not map place, it under. roots bleed, bridges lie.

â˜¿ âœ´ âœ´ â˜¿

the flock kneel there, teeth like milk, songs like worms in yr ear. they wait horn sound. when it blow you go. you must.

goats not goats. woods not woods. you will see.

ðŸ”»circle tighter every nightðŸ”»

dont answer bells in soil. they ring for you.

Awakened.,
