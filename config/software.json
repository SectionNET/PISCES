    "<p style='text-align: center; text-decoration: underline;'>AUTOPSY REPORT</p>",

    "<p style='text-align: center;'>Note: The following document is a reproduction of an original filed under Operation Covenant, Dec 1929 (PISCES-CVT#37) with an attachment summarising more recent analyses conducted by this office.</p>",

    "<p style='text-align: center;'>Subject: Robert Marsh<br>Date of Birth: 15 November 1883<br>Date of Death: 5 December 1929<br>Place of Death: Innsmouth, Massachusetts, United States<br>Occupation: Pastor, Esoteric Order of Dagon</p>",

    "<p style='text-align: center;'>Body of a well-built, physically deformed, adult white male. Height 5'7\", weight 162 lbs. Eyes are exophthalmic, and the eyelids degenerative and immobile. The earlobes are rudimentary and flat to the skull. The teeth are unusually sharp, with the first premolars resembling canine teeth in appearance. The jaw is significantly prognathous.</p>",

    "<p style='text-align: center;'>The skin shows patchy scaling and partial hair loss from all body parts. The lower neck is swollen and shows three deep parallel ridges on each side. The hands are enlarged with sharp, thickened nails and webbing of the fingers to just short of the first interphalangeal joint. The feet are greatly enlarged, and dorso-ventrally flattened with long toes with webbing almost to the tips. The ankles are twisted upwards so that the whole foot would not be in contact with the ground. The scrotum is not identified, and the penis is partially retracted into a fleshy fold in the groin.</p>",

    "<p style='text-align: center;'>Three bullet wounds are located in the upper chest, with no exit wounds.</p>",

    "<p style='text-align: center;'><strong>Radiographic Examination:</strong> The skeleton reflects the deformities noted above. A rudimentary additional set of sharp, canine-like teeth is observed in the rear of the jaw, below the roots of the molars and second premolars. Three bullets are observed in the chest cavity, one lodged in each lung, and one at the rear of the heart.</p>",

    "<p style='text-align: center;'><strong>Internal Examination:</strong> Cardiovascular system: The heart weighs 11 ounces, and wall of the left atrium and base of the aorta have been opened by a bullet wound. No other abnormalities seen.</p>",

    "<p style='text-align: center;'>Respiratory system: There has been partial destruction of each lung by bullet wounds. The lungs together weigh 2 lbs 3 oz. No other abnormalities seen apart from a slight hypertrophy of the larynx.</p>",

    "<p style='text-align: center;'>Digestive system: Three pharyngeal clefts are found bilaterally, parallel with the ridges on the exterior of the neck. The stomach contains a small quantity of digested food. The small intestine is reduced in length, measuring only 15 feet in length, as compared with a typical length of 22 feet. The appendix is reduced to a small diverticulum only half an inch in length. The hepatic and splenic flexures are reduced, so that the large intestine is somewhat shortened and presents a hoop-like shape in the abdominal cavity. Opening the intestine shows a spirally coiled fleshy septum lined by typical bowel mucosa, complete in the colon but partial in the small intestine and becoming reduced to only a ridge proximally. The septum terminates in the lower sigmoid colon. The liver weighs 4 lbs 7 oz. No abnormalities seen in the liver, gall bladder or pancreas.</p>",

    "<p style='text-align: center;'>Lymphatic system: No abnormalities seen. The spleen weighs 6 ounces.</p>",

    "<p style='text-align: center;'>Central nervous system: The brain shows reduced frontal lobes. No other abnormalities seen.</p>",

    "<p style='text-align: center;'>Genito-urinary system: The kidneys are multilobate with a reduced pelvis. The kidneys together weigh 10 ounces. The testicles are abdominal. The prostate is hypotrophic and the bulbourethral gland is not identified.</p>",

    "<p style='text-align: center;'>Endocrine system: The adrenal glands are flat and ragged in appearance and cover the upper one third of the kidney. No other abnormalities seen.</p>",

    "<p style='text-align: center;'><strong>Histological Examination:</strong> The skin showed hyperkeratosis and superficial scaling. The adrenal medulla was multilobate. No other abnormalities seen.</p>",

    "<p style='text-align: center;'><strong>Conclusions:</strong> The individual appears to suffer from an extreme form of a hereditary mutation syndrome determined to be endemic within the Innsmouth region and most likely the result of recurrent inbreeding. Several features of the syndrome are atavistic, resembling the anatomy of lower vertebrates.</p>",

    "<p style='text-align: center;'>Ia Cardiac arrest<br>Ib Trauma<br>II Hereditary deformities</p>",

    "<p style='text-align: center;'>TDBowerman<br>Dr TD Bowerman, MD</p>",

    "<p style='text-align: center;'><strong>Attachment:</strong> Various other individuals with similar deformities were also identified living in the Innsmouth area. The above case was one of the more extreme identified, and in most cases the deformities were slight and unlikely to cause any physical disability. The syndrome has since been identified in other isolated coastal communities in the United States and elsewhere. Reports of any further such communities are to be forwarded to PISCES HQ for evaluation. This matter is to be considered an issue of national security and PISCES will inform other relevant authorities within the Crown’s purview as the need arises.</p>",

    "<p style='text-align: center;'>Subject: Anomalous Entity #A1<br>Date of Death: 5 September 1984<br>Reporting Pathologist: Dr A Manara</p>",

    "<p style='text-align: center;'><strong>Circumstances:</strong> Unknown individual recovered from site of guerrilla massacre near Santo Domingo, Nicaragua by British intelligence operatives in advisory capacity. Reported to be feeding on bodies of the deceased. Neutralised after becoming hostile.</p>",

    "<p style='text-align: center;'><strong>External Examination:</strong> Body of a slender, muscular, adult male with substantial deformities. Height 181 cm, weight 77 kg. Age estimated at 25–35 years. Skin is pallid, hair dark and shoulder-length. The jaw is markedly prognathous, extending 5 cm with accompanying deformation of the lower skull. Upper canines enlarged to approximately double normal length, incisor teeth sharp and spatulate, cheek teeth bulky with exaggerated cusps. Nose long but relatively flat. Superior aspect of the auricles enlarged with sparse hair. Eyes brown, with unusually large pupils.</p>",

    "<p style='text-align: center;'>Fingernails thick and claw-like. Knuckles heavily calloused. The feet are enlarged, bearing two toes each with spatulate, uncut nails. Normal, uncircumcised, male genitalia.</p>",

    "<p style='text-align: center;'>Skin is tough and leathery across the whole body, and exhibits patches of encrusted mould on the left shoulder, upper right chest, left thigh, right hip and left back abdomen, reaching 9 cm maximum diameter. Seven entry wounds: four on the upper right chest, two on the right arm and one through the lower right neck, opening the oesophagus and penetrating the spinal column. Single exit wound, in the rear of the neck.</p>",

    "<p style='text-align: center;'><strong>Radiographic Examination:</strong> All skeletal elements present, with deformities consistent with those observed in the external examination. Four 5.56 mm calibre bullets lodged within the right lung, one within the musculature of the upper right arm, and one within the right humerus.</p>",

    "<p style='text-align: center;'><strong>Internal Examination:</strong> Cardiovascular system: No significant abnormalities, aside from exsanguination due to trauma. Heart weight: 332 g.</p>",

    "<p style='text-align: center;'>Respiratory system: No significant abnormalities. Right lung perforated by four bullet wounds. Right lung weight: 451 g; left lung: 438 g.</p>",

    "<p style='text-align: center;'>Digestive system: Crushed bone fragments up to 2 mm recovered from the mouth. Oesophagus lacerated on the right side by bullet wound. The stomach contains decayed flesh and offal, including skin consistent with human origin, bone fragments up to 5 mm and a small quantity of thin brown fluid. Flattened, oval, greyish nodules approximately 2 × 1.5 × 0.5 cm are found interspersed irregularly (averaging 10 cm apart) along the jejunum and upper to mid ileum. The nodules appear to be innervated by branches of the 8th to 10th thoracic spinal nerves. No other abnormalities. Liver weight: 1950 g.</p>",

    "<p style='text-align: center;'>Lymphatic system: Posterior mediastinal and external iliac lymph nodes significantly enlarged, up to 3 cm. Spleen weight: 195 g.</p>",

    "<p style='text-align: center;'>Central nervous system: No significant abnormalities.</p>",

    "<p style='text-align: center;'>Genito-urinary system: No significant abnormalities. Kidneys: 150 g each.</p>",

    "<p style='text-align: center;'>Endocrine system: Thyroid mildly hypotrophic (18 g). Thymus hypertrophic. Adrenals and pituitary macroscopically normal. Combined adrenal weight: 8 g.</p>",

    "<p style='text-align: center;'><strong>Histopathological Examination:</strong> Heart, lungs, stomach, liver, pancreas, spleen, brain, kidneys, testicles, thyroid, thymus, adrenals and pituitary show no special features. A random skin sample showed mild hyperkeratosis and dermal fibrosis. Mould samples taken from skin consisted of various saprophytic species not typically associated with infections in humans or animals.</p>",

    "<p style='text-align: center;'>Small bowel shows an increased number of lymphatic nodules. Mediastinal and external iliac lymph nodes show reactive changes only.</p>",

    "<p style='text-align: center;'>Nodules on the serosal surface of the small bowel are composed of neural tissue and contain cells of unknown type with dendritic extensions forming a plexus on the mucosal surface. These cells stained positive with neurological markers and ultrastructural examination confirmed neurofibrillary elements.</p>",

    "<p style='text-align: center;'>Cytogenetic examination revealed no chromosomal abnormalities.</p>",

    "<p style='text-align: center;'><strong>Conclusions:</strong> The individual appears to be a human suffering from a previously unidentified genetic and/or endocrinological syndrome. Enlargement of lymph nodes and spleen suggests a recent or ongoing immune response, though no infectious agents were identified in body fluids. Presence of saprophytic moulds on the skin is unusual, potentially linked to an immunologic deficiency.</p>",

    "<p style='text-align: center;'>Stomach contents indicate recent consumption of human flesh; jaw musculature and dentition sufficient to fracture human bone.</p>",

    "<p style='text-align: center;'>The bowel nodules are of a structured, sensory nature. Their purpose remains unknown and is not consistent with known human deformities.</p>",

    "<p style='text-align: center;'>Ia Cardiac arrest<br>Ib Trauma<br>II Unidentified deformation syndrome</p>",

    "<p style='text-align: center;'>A Manara</p>",

    "<p style='text-align: center;'><strong>Addendum:</strong> The cadavers of three further individuals exhibiting similar deformities have since been acquired by this Project. Summary follows:</p>",

    "<p style='text-align: center;'>AE#A2 – Male cadaver recovered in Colombia, 1989. Similar deformities; extensive keratinisation of toes, low forehead, flattened cranium.</p>",
    
    "<p style='text-align: center;'>AE#A3 – Male cadaver recovered in Zaire, 1997. Greater prognathism and longer teeth; pigmentation and hair suggest native African origin.</p>",

    "<p style='text-align: center;'>AE#A4 – Female cadaver recovered with AE#A3, presenting similar features. No reproductive anomalies identified.</p>",

    "<p style='text-align: center;'>All subjects had recently consumed human remains; no other dietary materials identified. All presented with similar lymphatic hypertrophy, possibly indicating a naturally heightened immune state. The function of the bowel nodules remains undetermined.</p>",

    "<p style='text-align: center;'>Subject: Anomalous Entity #C1<br>Date of Death: 1 August 1998<br>Reporting Pathologist: Dr A Manara</p>",

    "<p style='text-align: center;'><strong>Circumstances:</strong> Unknown individual discovered at what is believed to be the epicentre of animal and human experimentation, attributed to unknown persons or entities. Refer to debriefing files UKS-341/2.</p>",

    "<p style='text-align: center;'><strong>External Examination:</strong> Body of a slender humanoid of indeterminate age. Height 133 cm, weight 30 kg. Skin is smooth, hairless, and a neutral grey in colour. No visible signs of injury. The head is disproportionately large compared to the body (58 cm circumference). The jaw is reduced and bears only 28 teeth, the 2nd premolars and 3rd molars being absent. The nose is reduced. No auricles are present; the canal of the external ear opens directly onto the skull surface. The eyes are large and black, with no discernible iris or sclera.</p>",

    "<p style='text-align: center;'>There are no nails or friction pads on any fingers or toes. The hands lack the fifth digit, though the feet possess a full complement. Nipples and navel are absent. No external genitalia are present; the urethra opens via a simple pore.</p>",

    "<p style='text-align: center;'><strong>Radiographic Examination:</strong> The cranium, sternum, and pelvis show no discernible suture lines, appearing as single fused bones. The triquetral and pisiform bones of the wrist are absent, consistent with the absence of a fifth digit. Coccyx also absent.</p>",

    "<p style='text-align: center;'><strong>Internal Examination:</strong> Cardiovascular system: Minor vascular anomalies noted (see attached dissection diagrams). No signs of thrombosis or stenosis. Heart weight: 190 g.</p>",

    "<p style='text-align: center;'>Respiratory system: Both lungs unilobular; otherwise normal arrangement. Right lung: 235 g, left lung: 220 g.</p>",

    "<p style='text-align: center;'>Digestive system: Stomach contains a small volume of clear fluid. The caecum and appendix are absent; terminal ileal valve opens directly into ascending colon. No other abnormalities. Liver weight: 760 g.</p>",

    "<p style='text-align: center;'>Lymphatic system: No significant abnormalities. Spleen weight: 65 g.</p>",

    "<p style='text-align: center;'>Central nervous system: Cerebrum almost entirely smooth; only lateral and superior temporal sulci present as shallow grooves. Brain is otherwise in standard anatomical position.</p>",

    "<p style='text-align: center;'>Genito-urinary system: Kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra unremarkable. Kidney weight: 55 g each. No reproductive organs identified.</p>",

    "<p style='text-align: center;'>Endocrine system: Thyroid: 11 g. Adrenals: 3 g combined. No gross anomalies observed.</p>",

    "<p style='text-align: center;'><strong>Histopathological Examination:</strong> Samples from major organs (heart, lungs, stomach, liver, pancreas, spleen, brain, kidneys, thyroid, thymus, adrenals, pituitary) show no significant microscopic abnormalities.</p>",

    "<p style='text-align: center;'>Skin samples reveal complete absence of hair follicles. A pigmented waxy layer coats the epidermis, overlaying a reduced stratum corneum. Sebaceous gland cells contain unusually granular cytoplasm.</p>",

    "<p style='text-align: center;'>Sectioning of the right eye reveals an absent iris. The anterior chamber and lens are large, extending to the margins of the eyelids, rendering the sclera externally invisible.</p>",

    "<p style='text-align: center;'><strong>Cytogenetic Examination:</strong> Reveals a single X-chromosome, with neither Barr body nor Y-chromosome detected.</p>",

    "<p style='text-align: center;'><strong>Conclusions:</strong> The individual exhibits numerous anomalies when compared with the human baseline. The cerebrum is structurally simplified—more so than in higher mammals—though disproportionately large relative to body mass. Its simplicity implies an intelligence level insufficient for sentience or technological capability, barring instinctual use.</p>",

    "<p style='text-align: center;'>The absence of reproductive and vestigial organs such as the coccyx and appendix indicates structural minimalism. The pigmentation and granular features of the skin suggest a specialised, though undetermined, protective adaptation.</p>",

    "<p style='text-align: center;'>While some suggest extraterrestrial origin, the overwhelming anatomical and histological congruence with Homo sapiens indicates shared ancestry or derivation. Such biological proximity argues strongly against separate extraterrestrial evolution.</p>",

    "<p style='text-align: center;'>The brain’s simplicity alone challenges the subject’s capacity to operate any form of complex technology unaided.</p>",

    "<p style='text-align: center;'><strong>Cause of Death:</strong><br>1a – Insufficient data<br>1b –<br>1c –<br>2a – Probable non-human primate of unknown origin</p>",

    "<p style='text-align: center;'>A Manara</p>",

    "<p style='text-align: center;'><strong>Addendum:</strong> Four additional bodies were recovered at the scene. All were identical in morphology and DNA profile to Subject C1. The subjects are therefore likely to have originated from either multiple identical births or artificial cloning.</p>",
